# üö≤ Bicycle Shop Management System (Spring Boot + MS SQL Server)

This is a multi-tier Java-based application designed to manage core operations for a retail bicycle shop. It includes modules for managing customers, products, sales, returns, inventory, suppliers, service transactions, and user accounts with role-based access control.

Originally developed as part of a university project, this system is a follow-up to a prototype created in Microsoft Access (Project 1) and has been redesigned using Spring Boot and MS SQL Server to support a scalable, secure, and modular architecture.
